        <div class="skills__card-text">
          Naming is all about considering all aspects of a brand's existence when coming up with a name. We think about
          how it would sound when spoken, how it would be written in news releases, what it would look like, and how it
          would adapt to social media and mobile apps.

        <div class="skills__card-title">Design Strategy</div>
        <div class="skills__card-text">
          Design strategies treat design as a building block (using references) and provide various combinations of
          elements based on different areas of brand positioning while also determining the most promising direction
          together with the customer.

        <div class="skills__card-text">
          Corporate identity is a system of identification and the visual language of the brand. We create it, based on
          brand positioning, taking into account the specifics of user engagement points. When developing corporate
          identity, we think about where the brand will live, and we build a flexible but understandable system that
          will work effectively in any case.

          Infographics allow you to convey information in a simple and clear way. With it, we can briefly and easily
          outline a large volume of complex text or visualize a process. Infographics provide maximum information with
          minimal user effort.

          The final stage of the development of the brand identity is the regulation of the rules of its application. We
          draw up several documents, each of which covers a certain range of tasks. At the same time, all of them are
          aimed at making work with the brand simple, understandable, and convenient, both for marketers, brand
          managers, and designers in-house and for external partners.

        <div class="skills__card-text">
          A brand audit is a diagnostic of its key parameters and characteristics for understanding further ways of
          development. First of all, it answers the question of what stays and what changes in rebranding.
